# prs_calculations

This repository contains scripts and data for a comprehensive Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) analysis aimed at understanding the genetic contributions to obesity-related traits. 
Leveraging the GIANT Meta-analysis BMI GWAS as the base data and the Ragama cohort in Sri Lanka as the target data, the project utilizes custom scripts for data preprocessing, quality control, and PRS calculation. 
The analysis includes the identification of genetic variants near target genes, stringent data quality control steps, LD-based variant pruning, and PCA. 
The repository provides the tools and workflows to calculate PRS across various P-value thresholds and select the best-fit PRS that explains the highest phenotypic variance.
